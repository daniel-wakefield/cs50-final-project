I created a website for my final project.  I used the MVC model in order to implement it.
A lot of the design elements and organization are very similar to PSET7.  And I used a lot
of the functionality that was handed to me with pset7, especially the query function. 

The most difficult aspect of this project was getting the javascript working correctly. 
I wanted to be able to update the table live.  So I had to use javascript for this. I 
sent the query data for the table to the javascript using JSON, and then the functions
addRow and addColumn in order to add this new information to the table.  I also had to 
keep track of which of the entries had not yet been displayed, so I made us of a $_SESSION
variable in order to do this. 

I had a similarly difficult time keeping the information in the header accurate.  I used
a very similar set up to keep these values up to date, but I used setInterval() so that
they wouldn't need a button press from the user in order to be updated.  Instead they would
automatically get updated every five seconds. 

Those were definatley the most difficult aspects of this project and the ones that I am the
most proud of.  I would sincerely like to thank you for the experience of this course, it was
fascinating and very rewarding, if at times frustrating, to put it mildly.  Thank you so much,
this has truly been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
